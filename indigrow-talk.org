* What problems can machine learning solve?
  - Computer vision
  - Audio and text analysis
  - Traffic predictions
  - Social media and product recommendations
  - Spam filtering

* Types of machine learning
** Supervised
   - More commonly used
   - Training data is labeled ahead of time

** Unsupervised
   - No labeling is provided
   - Tries to find commonalities in the data
   - Usually used for identifying patterns in transaction data

* Graph data structure
  [[file:images/graph.png]]

  - Directed
  - Acyclic
  - Simple
  - Weighted

* Simple example - The =XOR= operation

  | A | B | Output |
  |---+---+--------|
  | 0 | 0 |      0 |
  | 0 | 1 |      1 |
  | 1 | 0 |      1 |
  | 1 | 1 |      0 |

  - Has well defined inputs and outputs
  - Very simple

* =XOR= as a graph

* Graph weightings
  [[file:images/ex2.png]]
  Randomly chosen between 0 and 1 based on a gaussian distribution

* Activation functions
  - The step function
    [[file:images/step.png]]

* Activation functions cont.
  - Linear function

* Human neurual biology
  - Machine learning is inspired by the structure of our brains
  - Each node in our graph represents a neuron
  - Our activation functions represent a neuron firing
  - Neurons don't fire in a linear manner

* Activation functions cont.
  - Sigmoid function
    [[file:images/sigmoid.jpg]]

* Back to =XOR=
  [[file:images/ex2.png]]

* Back to =XOR= cont.
  [[file:images/ex3.png]]
  - Sum our input values multiplied by their weights

* Back to =XOR= cont.
  [[file:images/ex4.png]]
  - Apply our activation function

* Back to =XOR= cont.
  [[file:images/ex5.png]]
  - Repeat for the next layer

* Teaching the machine aka Back propagation
  - 0.77 is a fair bit off from 0
  - We need to adjust the weightings in our graph
  - We'll work our way backwards

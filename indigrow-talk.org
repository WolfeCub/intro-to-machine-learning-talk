* What problems can machine learning solve?
  - Computer vision
  - Audio and text analysis
  - Traffic predictions
  - Social media and product recommendations
  - Spam filtering

* Types of machine learning
** Supervised
   - More commonly used
   - Training data is labeled ahead of time

** Unsupervised
   - No labeling is provided
   - Tries to find commonalities in the data
   - Usually used for identifying patterns in transaction data

* Graph data structure
  [[./graph.png]]

  - Directed
  - Acyclic
  - Simple
  - Weighted

* Simple example - The =XOR= operation

  | A | B | Output |
  |---+---+--------|
  | 0 | 0 |      0 |
  | 0 | 1 |      1 |
  | 1 | 0 |      1 |
  | 1 | 1 |      0 |

  - Has well defined inputs and outputs
  - Very simple

* =XOR= as a graph

* Graph weightings
  [[./ex2.png]]
  Randomly chosen between 0 and 1 based on a gaussian distribution

* Activation functions
  - The step function
